Description: Simple git client for R based on 'libgit2' with support for SSH and 
    HTTPS remotes. All functions in 'gert' use basic R data types (such as vectors
    and data-frames) for their arguments and return values. User credentials are
    shared with command line 'git' through the git-credential store and ssh keys
    stored on disk or ssh-agent.
